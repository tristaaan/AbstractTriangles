# Abstract Triangles
- Draws random SVG triangles with [RaphaelJS](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/).
- Adjust draw settings with [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui).
- Just for fun.

##Gulp
A `gulpfile.js` is included. Run a streaming server with `gulp serve`. Requires `gulp-less`[^1], and `browser-sync`.

[^1]:However there's no styling, it could be removed.
